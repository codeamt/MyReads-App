MyReads is a project from Udacity's React Nanodegree course. I implemented this project in the process of mentoring Grow With Google peers completing their degree on the Front End track.

This app enables the user to organize books by categories: currently reading, want to read, and already read. There is also search functionality to explore/add more books from Udacity's BooksAPI.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). A summary of to official [instructions](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) can be found below:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

## Deployment

`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favourite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.
